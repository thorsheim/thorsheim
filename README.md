- 👋 Hi, I’m @thorsheim
- 👀 I’m interested in passwords, pins, and anything you can possibly relate to digital authentication.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Github
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on passwords related stuff - but I'm not a developer who write code.
- 📫 How to reach me: @thorsheim (Twitter), and Mastodon: @thorsheim@mastodon.social
